# Roadmap

## In Progress

These are the features that I'm working on right now

### Components

Rescribe exposes a few layout related components already but to have a better docs experience,
a few more components would be nice to have.

- Accordions
- <del>Card and Card Groups</del>
- <del>Callouts of different statuses (info, warning, danger, success, etc.)</del> 
- <del>List</del>
- <del>Tabs</del>

## Planned Features

These are the features that I've planned to work on in the near future.

### Customizable colors

Right now, colors (text, border, etc.) are hard-coded. These should be customizable so docs and blog are consistent across the website.

### Full-text search

Search is part of any good documentation and building it into Rescribe would make things a lot easier.
