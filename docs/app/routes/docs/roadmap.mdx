# Roadmap

## Planned Features

These are the features that I've planned to work on in the near future.

### Components

Rescribe exposes a few layout related components already but to have a better docs experience,
a few more components would be nice to have.

- Accordions
- Card and Card Groups
- Callouts of different statuses (info, warning, danger, success, etc.)
- Tabs

### Full-text search

Search is part of any good documentation and building it into Rescribe would make things a lot easier.

## Feature Requests

Feel free to request features that you want on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues) page.
But do understand that it might take a while before it becomes available.

Also, feel free to contribute to any of the feature requests.
