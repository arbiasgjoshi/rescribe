This field is used to store short text. When used in a collection schema, Rescribe will render a text field. 

You can create a text field in your collection schema using the `text()` method in the Field API. You can create as many text fields as you want but `title` has to be one of them.

```javascript
blog: collection({
    // other options  
	schema: {
        // other fields
        title: fields.text({
			label: 'Title',
			description: 'Title of the post',
    	}),
        title: fields.text({
			label: 'Excerpt',
			description: 'Description of the post for SEO purposes',
            multiline: true
    	}),
	},
}),
```

## Options

### `label`

Label for the slug field so you can identify this field in the editor.

### `description`

Optional: Description for the slug field. This will also be rendered in the editor if available.

### `multiline`

Optional: Set to `true` if you want a textarea instead of an input field. 

*Note:* `title` *field will always be a textarea and will be styled differently from other text fields. It will also be front and center along with the* `content` *field. All other text fields can be accessed from the side panel.*
