This field is used to store URLs. When used in a collection schema, Rescribe will render a text field. This field will be validated on save to make sure the value is a valid URL.

You can create a URL field in your collection schema using the `url()` method in the Field API. 

```javascript
blog: collection({
    // other options  
	schema: {
        // other fields
        image: fields.url({
			label: 'Image URL',
			description: 'URL of the image uploaded to Cloudinary',
    	}),
	},
}),
```

## Options

### `label`

Label for the URL field so you can identify this field in the editor.

### `description`

Optional: Description for the URL field. This will also be rendered in the editor if available.
