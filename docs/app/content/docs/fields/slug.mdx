title: Slug Field
slug: fields/slug
---

This field is used to URL slugs. When used in a collection schema, Rescribe will render a text field. This text fieldâ€™s value will be validated on save and is used to create the markdown file in the `path` defined in your configuration.

You can create a slug field in your collection schema using the `slug()` method in the Field API. This is a required field and the key should be `slug`.

```javascript
blog: collection({
    // other options  
	schema: {
        // other fields
        slug: fields.slug({
			label: 'Slug',
			description: 'URL of the post',
    	}),
	},
}),
```

## Options

### `label`

Label for the slug field so you can identify this field in the editor.

### `description`

Optional: Description for the slug field. This will also be rendered in the editor if available.
