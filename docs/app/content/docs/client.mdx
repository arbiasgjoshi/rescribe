Rescribe clients are used to read the data youâ€™ve authored using the admin UI. `@rescribejs/server` exposes a `createClient()` function that you can use in your loaders.

```javascript
import { createClient } from '@rescribejs/server'
import { config } from '~/rescribe.config'

export const loader = async () => {
  const client = createClient(config)
}
```

`createClient()` returns an object that has interfaces to each of your collection. You can access the interface for a collection by accessing the same collection key you used in your configuration:

```javascript
const docs = client['docs']
```

## Interface Properties and Methods

Returns a list of items in the collection.

### `unique(where: { slug: string }, options: { headings: boolean })`

`unique()` takes a `where` object with a `slug` key. It returns the an object with the following properties: `code`, `content`, and `frontmatter`. `code` is the compiled version of the markdown content, `content` is the plain markdown content, and `frontmatter` contains the frontmatter stored in the markdown file.

### `_format`

Returns the markdown file format your content is stored in.

### `_label`
