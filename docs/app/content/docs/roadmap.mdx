## In Progress

These are the features/issues that I’m working on right now

### Customizable Colors

Right now, colors (text, border, etc.) in docs and blog are hard-coded. These should be customizable so docs and blog are consistent across the website.

[Github Issue #4](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/4)

### Pagination

Navigation to go to the next page and previous page at the bottom of the content in docs theme and in articles list in blog theme.

[Github Issue #7](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/7)

## Planned Features

### Full MDX support

While we can save files as MDX, the editor and output doesn’t support JSX in MDX files.

[Github Issue #15](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/15)

### i18n

Detect locales in directory names and generate locale selector in the navbar.

[Github Issue #8](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/8)

### Preview

It’ll be great if users could preview the content they’re writing. This should be a feature in blog and docs layouts. For custom output layouts, preview could be enabled using a dedicated splat route.

[Github Issue #16](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/16)
