## In Progress

These are the features/issues that I’m working on right now

### Customizable Colors

Right now, colors (text, border, etc.) in docs and blog are hard-coded. These should be customizable so docs and blog are consistent across the website. 

[Github Issue #4](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/4)

### Pagination

Navigation to go to the next page and previous page at the bottom of the content in docs theme and in articles list in blog theme.

[Github Issue #7](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/7)

## Planned Features

### Full MDX support

While we can save files as MDX the editor and output doesn’t support JSX in MDX files. 

[Github Issue #15](https://github.com/i4o-oss/rescribe/issues/15)

### i18n

Using Remix's file-based routing and MDX, detect locales in directory names and generate locale selector.
