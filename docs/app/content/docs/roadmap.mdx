# Roadmap

## In Progress

These are the features that I'm working on right now

### Customizable colors

Right now, colors (text, border, etc.) are hard-coded. These should be customizable so docs and blog are consistent across the website.

### Pagination

Navigation to go to the next page and previous page at the bottom of the content.

## Planned Features

These are the features that I've planned to work on in the near future.

### Full-text search

Search is part of any good documentation and building it into Rescribe would make things a lot easier.

### i18n

Using Remix's file-based routing and MDX, detect locales in directory names and generate locale selector.
